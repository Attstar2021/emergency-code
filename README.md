### Fonts and color

Exo, Roboto, and Montserrat are popular font choices for a variety of design projects due to their versatility and readability. 
Exo is a modern sans-serif font that has a clean and futuristic look, making it suitable for technology-based designs. 
Roboto, on the other hand, is a more traditional sans-serif font with a humanist touch, giving it a more friendly and approachable feel, making it suitable for both digital and print materials. 
Montserrat is a geometric sans-serif font that has a distinctive style with a vintage touch, making it suitable for designs that require a retro or nostalgic feel. 

Additionally, all three fonts have a range of weights and styles that allow for flexibility in design, making them suitable for a variety of projects. Whether it's for a website, logo, or printed material, Exo, Roboto, and Montserrat are excellent choices for designers looking for fonts that are modern, versatile, and highly readable.

An earth color scheme is an excellent choice for NGOs, as it communicates the organization's connection to nature and the environment. Using colors such as brown, green, and blue creates a warm and inviting palette that reflects the organization's values and mission.
Brown, as a grounding color, symbolizes stability and dependability, making it an ideal choice for an NGO that aims to make a lasting impact on the environment. 
Green, on the other hand, is associated with growth and vitality, and it represents the NGO's commitment to sustainability and the protection of natural resources. 
Blue is a calming color that is often used to represent water, making it a great choice for an organization that focuses on protecting oceans, rivers, and other bodies of water. Together, these colors create a cohesive and natural color scheme that is visually appealing and emotionally resonant. By using an earth color scheme, NGOs can connect with their target audience and communicate their commitment to environmental preservation and sustainable development.

## Deployment

The master branch (main) of this repository has been used for the deployed version of this application.

## Using Github & Gitpod

To deploy our project, we had to use the [Code Institute Full Template](tbc).

- Click the Use This Template button.

- Add a repository name and brief description.

- Click the Create Repository from Template to create your repository.

- To create a Gitpod workspace you then need to click Gitpod, this can take a few minutes.

When you want to work on the project it is best to open the workspace from Gitpod (rather than Github) as this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one. You should pin the workspace so that it isn't deleted.

Committing your work should be done often and should have clear/explanatory messages, use the following commands to make your commits:
- git add . :  adds all modified files to a staging area
- git commit -m "A message explaining your commit": commits all changes to a local repository.
- git push: pushes all your committed changes to your Github repository.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository you will be able to make a copy of the original repository on your own GitHub account allowing you to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" button on the menu, locate the "Fork" button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open command line interface on your computer
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
    - $ git clone ADD Project link
7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## Deployment To Heroku

- The App live link is: TBC!
- The project was deployed to Heroku using the following steps.
- Log in to Heroku and create an App.
- At the Deploy tab, select GitHub as the deployment method.
- Select the repository name and click Search. Once it is found, click Connect.
- Select the branch you want to deploy, then click Deploy Branch.

The deployment process should happen smoothly in case all deployment files are fully functional. Click now the button Open App on the top of the page to access your App.
